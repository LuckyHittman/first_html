<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>

<p>A long time ago, in a lower middle class duplex between Menomonee Falls and Brown Deer, a baby was born. This young boy, was born in the early evening hours of Saturday July 16.
  To make things more interesting, <il>I</il> was born at home--intentionally!</p>

  <p>We moved to Door County, WI and there I graduated high school and almost immediately after, joined the US Army. I was in boot camp during 9/11 and forever changed the scale/magnititude of 
    military service. Fortunately, I was not ever deployed to Afghanistan but Iraq in 2005 to 2006 as an 11B2, or fire team leader for an infantry unit. We conducted military convoy security
    for sustainment missions throughout the country. Upon return from Iraq, I attended first St. Norbert college and then switched over to UW Green Bay (way cheaper!). I graduated in 2009
    with a degree in Communications: Public Relations and got my first real job with the Deparmtment of Veterans Affairs: Veterans Benefits Administration in Milwaukee. That job was supposed to be
    a short stint but lasted 9 years because I loved what I did.</p>
